# ThreeNative Status

This file is the current implementation front door. Read it before the
conceptual docs when deciding what is supported, partial, or future-facing.

## Current Active Gate

V3: first-person forest environment scene.

Current release command:

```bash
pnpm verify:v3
```

## V3 Proves

- deterministic environment scene IR for the forest proof scene
- bundle-local glTF/GLB, `.bin`, and texture dependency copying
- web Three.js environment preview with first-person walkthrough checks
- Bevy native loading of the same environment bundle for scene load smoke and
  bookmarked screenshot artifacts
- V3 web performance budget reporting
- bookmarked visual verification artifacts
- atmosphere metadata checks for the V3 scene
- walkability and blocking probes for the V3 scene

## V3 Does Not Prove

- general gameplay ECS/system hosting
- native TypeScript or QuickJS gameplay scripting
- portable UI runtime
- mobile packaging
- full physics engine parity
- full Three.js, R3F, or Drei compatibility
- editor tooling
- custom shaders, render graph, or postprocessing parity

## Status Levels

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ | Implemented and verified for the stated scope. |
| ⚠️ | Partial implementation, known drift, or target-specific behavior exists. |
| 🧪 | Schema-only, experimental, or not release-gated. |
| ❌ | Not implemented. |
